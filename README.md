# PyGameRPG
A project I did on 12th grade, unfortunately it's not finished but I still find the project quite interesting.

Please, run the file "game.py" in the IDE of your choice and be sure to have pygame installed before running it.
Note that this was no professional project nor school project, but a personal one.
